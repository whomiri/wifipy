# WiFi Tools Repository

Wifi packages adapted to Python Language

This repository contains various Python scripts designed for educational purposes related to network testing, security assessments, and password cracking. These tools are intended for ethical hacking and should only be used on networks for which you have explicit permission.

# Scripts Overview

1. deauth.py

This script performs deauthentication attacks on WiFi networks. It sends deauth packets to a specified target device, disconnecting it from the network. This tool is useful for testing the resilience of wireless networks against deauthentication attacks.

2. networktester.py
   
This script tests the performance and stability of a network. It measures parameters such as ping response time, packet loss, and overall network speed. This information can help diagnose network issues and assess performance.

3. pass.py

This script attempts to crack WiFi passwords using a dictionary attack. It takes a password list and a target WiFi network's handshake file to test against. This tool is for educational purposes only, to demonstrate the importance of strong passwords.

4. scanp.py

This script uses Nmap (Network Mapper) to perform network scanning. It identifies active devices on the network and gathers information about their open ports and services. Itâ€™s a valuable tool for network discovery and security assessments.

5. strg.py

This script generates a security test report based on the results of the network tests. It compiles data from previous scripts and presents it in a structured format, highlighting vulnerabilities and recommendations for improving network security.

#Usage
Copy to the computer by git clone. You should examine the texts in the files one by one and use them. We closed the general usage path so that it would not be easy for someone who does not understand it to use it. You need to manually run and use the files by editing them one by one.
